A small JS project to show names in Akan, based on the date of birth entered.
Work in progress.

// To DO:
    // 1. Limit what can be entered in text box
    // 2. Attract more attention to the newName shown
    // 3. Some more paragraphs below form about name, day of week of birth, etc
    // 4. Allow calendar picker to populate input
    // 5. Reset button to also reset the new name shown in the <h1> header
    // 6. Edit menu to be more relevant.
